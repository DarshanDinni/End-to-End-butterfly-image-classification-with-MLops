# Butterfly Image Classifier

## Overview

The Butterfly Image Classification project revolves around a diverse dataset featuring 75 distinct classes of butterflies. Comprising over 1000 labeled images, including validation samples, each image is exclusively associated with a single butterfly category.

The training dataset, encapsulated in Training_set.csv, contains labeled images crucial for model training. Additionally, the Testing_set.csv includes a list of images in the test folder, where the objective is to predict the corresponding labels.

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying butterfly species based on images.
